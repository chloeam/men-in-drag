Audition season is upon us, and we are so excited to hear some new voices! Auditions will take place on the Tuesday and Wednesday of First Week (9/29 and 9/30), 6pm-10pm, in Cobb Hall.

There will be two opportunities to sign up for audition slots: the A Cappella Open House (Thursday 9/24, 11am-1pm in Hallowed Grounds) and the fall A Cappella Showcase (Monday 9/28, 8:30pm in Hutch Commons). If you're not sure which a cappella group is right for you, you'll be able to see all of the groups perform at the Showcase!
