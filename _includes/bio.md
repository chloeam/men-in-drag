Their songs have been featured on national a cappella compilation albums Sing, Best of Collegiate A Cappella (BOCA), and Voices Only, and they released their first music video in 2012. During the 2013-14 season, MiD released "Coming Undone," which was recently nominated for three Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards and featured on international a cappella compilation album sing 10: neon, hosted AcappellaFest, a Midwest CASA-produced a cappella festival, embarked on their fifth annual winter tour, competed in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA), and put on three campus performances.
